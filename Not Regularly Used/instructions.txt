Files needed: rel_profile_wave_pkg.f parfile.dat

Additional files provided: instructions.txt (this file),
pgplot.pdf (plot of the default model, for reference). 

The main program is in rel_profile_wave_pkg.f. That single file
includes all the subroutines needed. Compile the program using the
first command below to produce the executable named rel_profile_wave_pkg.x.

gfortran -o rel_profile_wave_pkg.x rel_profile_wave_pkg.f

If there is a problem with the above command then try one the
following versions

gfortran -std=legacy -O3 -lgcc -lSystem -o rel_profile_wave_pkg.x rel_profile_wave_pkg.f

gfortran -Wl,-no_pie -std=legacy -fPIC -O3 -lgcc -o rel_profile_wave_pkg.x rel_profile_wave_pkg.f

Then, run the executable. It will read the file parfile.dat and report
on its contetnts. Running the program with the original version of
parfile.dat will lead to the following messages

All 27 expected parameters retrieved from parfile.dat                        

 NOTE: XISPIN = 0 or < XI1. Reseting XISPIN = XI1.

Wavelength scale constructed from input parameters
Final range:  6300.0 -  6900.0 A, Step:   2.0 A,   301 pixels
[requested range:  6300.0 -  6900.0 A]

Note: The following floating-point exceptions are signalling: IEEE_UNDERFLOW_FLAG IEEE_DENORMAL (this note may or may not show up)
STOP >*< End of program rel_profile_wave!

The program will generate a new file called model.dat

If the above works as described, your gfortran installation works, the
command syntax is right, and the necessary libraries are available and
accessible. By the way, in the above string of messages, the last one
that starts with "Note: The following floating-point exceptions are
signalling:" is a system-level command. All other commands above it
come from the programitself. As long as you are not getting messages
that contain the work "ERROR" the program is running properly and
manages to catch improper values of the input parameters and fix them.

The next exercise is to plot the model contained in model.dat. Look at
the contents of the file to verify that there is a header block (lines
starting with #) followed by two columns that give the wavelength and
flux density. The read these columns and plot the spectrum. Compare
your plot with the plot contained in pgplot.pdf to see if they agree.

Here are some extra exercises to try (optionally). Use a simple
text editor that can open and read an ASCII file (not a word
processor). Make sure that the files are not altered at all in the
process of reading them.

Make a backup copy of parfile.dat to preserve its contents. Look
inside the file parfile.dat and read the explanations of a few of the
parameters paying attention to the values they are allowed to
take. Then, edit some of the parameters and give them values that are
not allowed. Run rel_profile_wave_pkg.x to see if it catches the
problems and issues any (new) messages.
